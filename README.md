# Memory Game

## This is a memory game.

### I use on the website:

- _Javascript_<br/>
- _HTML_<br/>
- _CSS_<br/>

**What's the idea?** <br/>
The game builds a beginner-friendly memory card. The game has a card grid, each with a colour. You have to find the matching cards.

**Website features:**

- The different cards are turned face down;
- Ðœatched cards remain face up.
