# Memory Game

## This is a memory game.

### I use on the website:

- _Javascript_<br/>
- _HTML_<br/>

**What's the idea?** <br/>
The game build a beginner-friendly memory card. The game have a grid of cards,
where each card have a color. You have to find the matching cards.

**Website features:**

- Тhe different cards are turned face down;
- Мatched cards remain face up.
